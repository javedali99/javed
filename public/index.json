Choose your own adventure Deciding to become certified Certification components Learning the pedagogy Preparing for the exams Additional resources   Why did I get trained? Teaching R was not something I thought I‚Äôd ever get into but a couple of reasons were nudging me towards getting some formal training.\nI wanted to be able to‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶support my coworkers in their own data analysis projects and be better prepared to introduce R to undergraduate students coming through and hoping to apply learned skills elsewhere ‚Ä¶incorporate data analysis into the research efforts of my local organizing collective, and was feeling ill-equipped to lead our group. Most collective members have very little experience with data analysis, if any, and none have programming experience  After the RStudio Instructor training I can confidently say I feel prepared for both of these challenges!\n Choose your own adventure Jump down to a panel on the RStudio Certification hosted by the MiR Community Jump down to a list of teaching exam examples and Tidyverse sample exam solutions shared openly by other instructors Keep reading to find out what I learned before I decided to pursue the certification and what the certification experience was like for me.   Deciding to become certified Asking around In the interest of making an informed decision, I asked a few instructors to share a bit about their experience with the certification process before I made the commitment.\n üá∫üá∏ Stephan Kadauke is a colleague I met through the Children‚Äôs Hospital of Philadelphia R User group. Specifically at an Intro to Machine Learning with the Tidyverse workshop led by Alison Hill.  I met these wonderful people through the R-Ladies Global Slack workspace:\n üá¶üá∑ Yanina Bellini Saibene shared her experience with this process in her blog post Obtaining RStudio certification. A shared path. üá≥üá± Paloma Rojas-Saunero shared her view as a Ph.D.¬†candidate with experience teaching R in R-Ladies workshops and as a teaching assistant in biostatistics courses. üá∞üá™ Shelmith Kariuki speaks to her experience in her blog post The RStudio Certification Process.  Here‚Äôs what folks had to say! Highlights are shared with the authors‚Äô permission and my gratitude to them.\nWhat made you want to pursue the certification?  One, it gave me incentive to read R for Data Science cover to cover which I had been meaning to do for a while. Two, I‚Äôm teaching R and the certification gives me some gravitas to do that. Three, it forced me to critically think about cognitive load theory, concept mapping, and lesson development, all of which are super useful when you actually have to develop lessons. ‚ÄìStephan\n  I pursued the certification for a few reasons. First because I am really enthusiastic about teaching and I love the tidyverse, so I wanted to find opportunities of teaching it outside my university. Second because I feel that RStudio is growing so fast on teaching materials that sharing with other instructors would be a great way to always keep updated. And last but not least, I was also encouraged by the idea of going through the process with Yanina Bellini Saibene and other amazing women as she discusses in her blog post. ‚ÄìPaloma\n  What did you think of the training itself, particularly the pedagogical aspects?  The training is top notch. In my mind, Greg Wilson is the #1 authority when it comes to teaching programming and R in particular. ‚ÄìStephan\n  I think the best part is to take and learn the pedagogical aspect. Greg Wilson is an awesome trainer and you will love as a student all the tools and techniques that he teaches you. For learning this, the course is already worth it. All the content is more developed in the book Teaching Tech Together by Greg Wilson if you want to look it over. ‚ÄìYanina\n  About the training, it was mind blowing, it changed my view of teaching not only programming but everything. Greg‚Äôs book is amazing and the way he teaches is outstanding. I learned so much. ‚ÄìPaloma\n  Have you been able to implement what you learned in some way either at work or elsewhere?  Yes! As you probably saw, I‚Äôm teaching the intro to R course for R/Medicine. And I‚Äôve been teaching a similar course to doctors, in addition to some other teaching sessions that I‚Äôve done for the CHOP R User group and/or medical resident teaching. ‚ÄìStephan\n  Yes! Immediately. I delivered 3 in-person courses after training and more than 15 courses on-line using all the pedagogical tools. I also co-founded Metadocencia where we share practical tools to help teachers teach online (volunteer-run and free) using these principles learned in the training. I also use some of the tools for my work as the chief of a research group for some meetings and identifying the target of some of our development (especially concept maps and learner personas). ‚ÄìYanina\n  I think I use what I learned so far even when I am preparing my work presentations, when developing any type of class, event, book club, etc. Overall it was an experience that made me reflect a lot on how teaching is usually done, how is my teaching so far and an inspiration about the teacher I want to be. ‚ÄìPaloma\n    Attending the MiR panel If you read the questions and responses above you might have noticed one character in this story that I haven‚Äôt introduced yet. His name is Greg Wilson. I tend to take such strong endorsements with a spoonful of skepticism and (spoiler alert) I‚Äôm happy to say I fully agree with everything that was said by those above. In that spirit, I‚Äôll add my own glowing recommendation:\n Greg Wilson is truly a programming pedagogy expert, and an incredibly kind human being. I‚Äôm grateful to have learned from him within the context of the certification, and appreciate being able to continue learning from his example in a variety of other contexts.\n Nevertheless, I‚Äôm glad I got to do a gut-check beforehand when I attended the RStudio Instructor Certification Panel hosted by the MiR Community and facilitated by Dorris Scott and Danielle Smalls-Perkins. You‚Äôll notice Yanina and Shelmith were two of the panelists! Hearing from this panel was the last piece of the puzzle I needed to feel like pursuing the certification was an enthusiastic yes.\n   Certification components The certification itself has three components:\nInstructor training covering modern teaching methods. Materials for this training are available here and are based on the book Teaching Tech Together written by Greg (and currently undergoing translation into Spanish by a team of volunteers!).\n A 90-minute teaching exam based on content from the instructor training. This includes a 15-minute demonstration lesson and a written component.\n A 90-minute Tidyverse exam to test your knowledge of the subject matter in R for Data Science (make sure to check the program FAQs for information about the Shiny exam)\n   Learning the pedagogy When I completed the instructor training on pedagogy it took place completely online over three days. The first two days were dedicated to the materials linked in the earlier section and were taught by Greg. Despite the training starting at 7am for me, I really enjoyed it! There were 12 of us in the cohort and there were a handful of opportunities for us to do activities in small groups and multiple opportunities to practice the teaching tools that will help us better support R learners in our own teaching.\nSome of my favorite topics were mental models, cognitive capacity, and formative assessments. At the heart of all three is the concept map, which serves as a guide for reverse-designing a lesson and delivering it effectively. You can find examples of concept maps here as slides and here on GitHub. I‚Äôve found concept maps to come in handy in so many other places in my life and I even made one to help me plan out this blog post. Check it out:\nThe third day of training, our cohort had the pleasure of learning all about using the learnr üì¶ to build interactive R tutorials, from Mine √áetinkaya-Rundel:\n  Course website: rstudio/io/rit  Slides: building interactive tutorials in R  RStudio Cloud project: rstd.io/rit-cloud  Source materials: rstudio-education/instructor-training   Preparing for the exams Teaching exam I relied on the instructor training materials and my in-class notes to prepare my demonstration lesson and study for the written component of the teaching exam. For anything that didn‚Äôt fully sink in, I consulted Teaching Tech Together.\nYou can find all materials for my teaching demonstration on GitHub. They include the slides below and this R Markdown file that I used to incorporate live coding into the lesson.\nI found an excellent reference for a demonstration lesson in Florencia D‚ÄôAndrea‚Äôs post Two examples of iteration with purrr - Class for the RStudio certification.\nIt comes highly recommended that someone take a look at each one of our lessons before it ships out because it seems it‚Äôs common not to realize we‚Äôve packed too much in! Yanina was kind enough to sit through my lesson as a learner and provided fantastic feedback. Some of the things I was able to work on before my teaching exam included providing context for the lesson at the beginning (asking the learner to download the file, introducing the lesson in the context of a workshop, etc.) and talking through all my key strokes during the live coding portions. Thanks again Yani!\n fitvids('.shareagain', {players: 'iframe'});   Tidyverse exam Lucky for me the MiR Community organized some study sessions specifically for preparing for the Tidyverse exam! Dorris and I met regularly to discuss our approach to the sample exam (v2.0) and present chapters of R for Data Science that we weren‚Äôt as comfortable with. Yanina joined us for some of the sessions to lend us her expertise and provide tips and tricks!\nOne of the recommendations Yanina made was to explore the RStudio Primers for any topic we wanted to practice. For me that meant iteration using purrr‚Äôs map functions. After the iteration primer and the companion R for Data Science chapter, I felt like I could iterate all day every day.\nIn real life, both the written portion of the teaching exam and the Tidyverse exam are very much like the sample exams provided on the RStudio Education blog. You can find those here:\n Sample exam v1.0 (February 2020): Instructor Certification Exams Sample exam v2.0 (August 2020): More sample exams  If you‚Äôre a member of the MiR Community and like the idea of studying with some structure and friendly accountability, join us for the study group!

Super helpful, though because I came to it 2.5 years late, it was more like ‚Äòup and running with lots of water breaks‚Äô because I had to stop and account for changes made to the Hugo Academic theme in the meantime.\n For example, prior to Academic version 4.6, custom CSS was added using the plugins_css option in params.toml, but in current version 4.8, the theme supports SCSS (a superset of CSS) and a custom.scss file is added in the assets/scss/ folder.  The going futher section in Alison‚Äôs post specifically talks about customizing the out-of-the-box theme and Alison directly links to her custom CSS file, which I closely referred to when changing colors in my custom SCSS file.\nAlison‚Äôs CSS helped me customize everything from text colors and fonts to alert colors and borders for Academic‚Äôs light mode. At this point I had the light mode looking the way I wanted but the dark mode still used out-of-the-box colors for the most part and they just didn‚Äôt go.\nSo I decided not to enable the dark-mode option in params.toml until I could figure out how to customize my stylesheet accordingly. That time has come because it turns out it‚Äôs pretty straightforward!\nThe Blogdown book does an excellent job summarizing what you need to know about CSS. This post builds on that a little by incorporating features made possible by SCSS including variables.\n 2 Choose your own adventure Check out the SCSS file linked above  to see how I customized my theme. Keep reading to follow along and learn with me .   3 Why Atom? Atom is a text editor that I like to use to modify any files in my website directory. I say modify because I much prefer to create content for posts like this one using the Blogdown addins in RStudio. It‚Äôs such a breeze! But here‚Äôs why I think Atom is a fantastic companion to the RStudio IDE:\nSeeing your directory files is made friendly in Tree View when you open your website folder as a ‚Äòproject folder‚Äô. You can just click on the file once to preview it and double-click if you want to actually open it. I find this to be really helpful when I can‚Äôt remember which file contains what I‚Äôm looking for because I don‚Äôt have to actually open each file to see what‚Äôs in it. Searching for something specific is easy with the built-in search tool. I‚Äôve used this many times when I can‚Äôt remember where that specific parameter (e.g.¬†fonts) or file type (e.g.¬†.scss) is located within my directory. I also find it super handy to find specific HTML color codes or color variables. This brings me to my most favorite feature in Atom‚Ä¶ The pigments package! Like R, Atom has a universe of handy packages and pigments will display colors behind the code text that represents it. It‚Äôs kind of magical and has been a real game changer for me. Having this package will make customizing your scss file much easier on the eyes and brain.   You may also choose to install the highlight-selected package to make highlighted text easier to spot throughout your file and the file-icons package to make it easier to discern between different file types in your tree view. You can install packages in Atom \u0026gt; Preferences \u0026gt; Install.   4 Adding dark mode definitions to stylesheet Looking through GitHub issues I found that including two sub-themes, one for light mode and one for dark mode, may be considered for Academic in the future but is not a priority. A related issue shared that if you use a custom CSS, you can define .dark .\u0026lt;SELECTOR-NAME\u0026gt; {...} for dark mode.\nNot knowing what all of the options were for dark mode, I took a look at the dark.scss dark mode stylesheet built in to Academic in themes/hugo-academic/assets/scss/academic/ folder. You can see the pigments package in action here! It makes it easier to identify elements with colors that you want to change. I‚Äôm looking at you inline code text color  rgb(139, 233, 253) .  Another way to find the css for the element you want to change is to use your browser‚Äôs web inspector tool. In the screenshot below from Hugo Academic‚Äôs customization documentation I right-clicked on themes/academic/data/themes/minimal.toml and then clicked on ‚Äúinspect element‚Äù. The element code was .dark pre, .dark code which you might recognize from the code in dark.scss.\nYou can copy and paste this new .dark theme code a new (or existing) custom.scss file saved in the assets/scss/ folder of your directory to start seeing how changes you make affect the look of your site.\n 5 Choosing dark theme colors Alright. Now that we have some new dark theme code in our custom file, we can move on to the exciting task of choosing colors! If you‚Äôre looking for some inspiration, Coolors has some dark color palettes:\nCoolors is also a great place to save colors into custom palettes. Here‚Äôs a basic example of mine:\nIf you‚Äôre like me and want to design a dark theme that uses the primary and secondary colors you picked for your light theme, keep reading! I‚Äôm gonna share highlights from what I learned about dark theme design and how to ensure your color combinations meet Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).\nThe bulk of what I learned came from the extensive Material Design resources, including (of course) the dark theme foundational material, which will look familiar if you‚Äôve ever used an Android device.\n5.1 Basics of dark theme design  The primary surface color for dark themes should be dark gray, rather than black. The recommended color is #121212   .  As you layer components, surfaces with a higher elevation (closer to the hypothetical ‚Äòlight source‚Äô) should be lighter than those below it to create a visual hierarchy. This can be achieved by applying a semi-transparent white overlay to the primary dark gray surface.   The primary text color for dark themes should not be 100% opaque white (i.e.¬†#FFFFFF    ) because it can appear to bleed or blur against dark backgrounds and be difficult to read. Text hierarchy is established by controlling the opacity, for example:  High emphasis text is white with 87% opacity    Medium emphasis is white with 60% opacity    Disabled text is white with 38% opacity     To meet WCAG AA standard, there must be a 4.5:1 contrast level between the body text and the dark theme surface at the highest/lightest elevation. The contrast level is 7:1 for the WCAG AAA standard.   5.2 Tools to explore palettes Material Design has a color palette generator and a color tool that can be used to dark and light variants of a color. I used the color tool to find a dark and light variant of my primary and secondary colors. The accessibility feature of the color tool is helpful to determine the minimum opacity for white text to ensure enough contrast. The Coolors color contrast checker is another great tool.\n  6 Color variables One of the cool features of SCSS is the ability to use variables defined by prefix $ (i.e.¬†$spc-primary: #122140;. You can set your variables at the top of your SCSS file and use the variable name throughout the file. This makes it super easy to try out different dark mode colors without having to use find-and-replace. If you‚Äôre using the pigments package in Atom, it‚Äôll even show you the variable colors in a dropdown!\n Tip: I like using a bright color like  red   to test color changes for different CSS elements because stands out and makes it easier to see what was modified.\n I defined my primary colors and variants, text colors, and various background colors as variables. And although dark gray (#121212) is recommended as a standard dark theme background, you can also create a custom background color by mixing it with your primary color. In my case I used mix(#122140, #121212, 40) to create a color that was 40% my primary color and 60% dark gray.\n I controlled white text opacity by using rgba() in CSS which accepts an alpha value between 0 and 1.\n Now, ideally I‚Äôd be able to define the result of this mix() as a color variable, but some CSS properties like background-color don‚Äôt recognize it. So I had to convert the result to a color code and define that as a variable instead. Pigments made this conversion easy when I toggled the menu (Shift+Command+P on a Mac) and searched for the Pigments: Convert options.\nThis mix() function also came in handy when defining background surfaces with semi-transparent white overlays.\nAnd that‚Äôs a wrap. Have fun building your new custom dark theme!\n ","date":1592265600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1592328133,"objectID":"680e19ffe696f7ed70fb3d7731684abd","permalink":"/2020-06-16-dark-theme-custom-with-atom/","publishdate":"2020-06-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/2020-06-16-dark-theme-custom-with-atom/","section":"post","summary":"Tutorial on how to customize the dark mode in Hugo's Academic theme with help from the Atom text editor package Pigments.","tags":["atom","blogdown","r","scss"],"title":"Customizing Hugo Academic's Dark Mode with Help from Atom","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":["R minis"],"content":"    1 What to expect 2 Choose your own adventure 3 Follow along with me! 4 Importing JSON file 5 Parsing information 6 Exporting to CSV 7 Formatting in Airtable 8 Moving forward   Airtable is a user-friendly and powerful tool that until recently I‚Äôd been using for personal projects (i.e.¬†document organizing, apartment hunting, etc.). A couple of weeks ago I leaned on Airtable to create a base designed for the Philadelphia Reproductive Freedom Collective to support our COVID-19 mutual aid efforts.\n Shout out to the Silicon Valley Democratic Socialists of America who provided inspiration and support! Their mutual aid network is extensive and operates at an impressive scale. Get connected with the South Bay Mutual Aid network here: https://www.aidnetwork.org/\n Having fallen in some Airtable deep-work I figured maybe it was time to retire my Trello boards in favor of some task bases. Airtable accepts CSV files from Trello but, alas, my free Trello account only gave me the option to print as a PDF or export as JSON. I decided this would be a good opportunity to learn how to parse JSON data and export it as a CSV ready for import to Airtable.\n1 What to expect The code provided in the R Markdown file requires the tidyverse, JSONlite, and lubridate packages as well as a JSON file containing your Trello data. It will generate the following:\n tidy_cards.csv file ready to import to Airtable attachments folder containing any content you‚Äôve attached to your cards using a URL. attachment_errors.csv file containing the card name, or task, as well as the URL/file path of any attachments that failed to download (i.e.¬†links to files stored locally), so that you exactly which links you‚Äôll need to locate manually.  By the end of the tutorial you‚Äôll have imported a CSV file into Airtable and configured Airtable to match your Trello board. Specifically, you‚Äôll be able to migrate labels, lists, attachments, card names, card descriptions, card due dates, date last modified, and whether the cards were marked ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù or archived.\n1.1 What not to expect  Rendered markdown from your card descriptions. Airtable does support markdown in its ‚Äúlong text‚Äù field type, but it doesn‚Äôt automatically render from imported text.    2 Choose your own adventure Download the R Markdown file linked above  and run with it. Jump down to section Formatting in Airtable for pointers on how to get your Airtable base configured like your Trello board. Keep reading for a code-through of the R Markdown file, using the example featured in the picture above, with tips and resources along the way.   3 Follow along with me! The Trello board used for this code-through is this Program Management Template created by Soniya Ahuja. To download the Trello board data, go to Menu \u0026gt; More \u0026gt; Print and Export and then right-click on ‚ÄúExport as JSON‚Äù to save the JSON file in your working directory. Or save a little time and download the program-mgmt.json file linked above .\nYou may also choose to read through Making Sense of Trello‚Äôs JSON Export.\nLast but not least ‚Äì we‚Äôll be keeping things tidy, with the help of the tidyverse collection of R packages, to ensure each variable is in its own column, observations are in rows, and values are in cells.

We‚Äôll be parsing information about the cards as well as the lists and then joining them together by a common identifier id or idShort.\n 5 Parsing information Parsing information from JSON data was not something I was familiar with and found myself coming back to Kan Nishida‚Äôs post Working with JSON data in a very simple way time and time again throughout this process.\n5.1 Cards The first step is to extract information about the Trello cards themselves. This information is contained within a list of data frames and requires flattening which makes the nested hierarchical data structure into a flatter structure by assigning each of the nested variables its own column as much as possible. Then, the most important variables are selected as cards_trim before moving on to extracting label information.\n# selecting cards information cards \u0026lt;- trello$cards # list of 1 # flattening cards_flat \u0026lt;- flatten(cards) #list of 37 # tibble time cards_flat_tbl \u0026lt;- as_tibble(cards_flat) # 32 obs of 37 variables glimpse(cards_flat_tbl) ## Rows: 32 ## Columns: 37 ## $ id \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b95012422\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b95‚Ä¶ ## $ address \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,‚Ä¶ ## $ checkItemStates \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,‚Ä¶ ## $ closed \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE‚Ä¶ ## $ coordinates \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,‚Ä¶ ## $ creationMethod \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,‚Ä¶ ## $ dateLastActivity \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;2020-05-05T02:41:56.366Z\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;2020-05-05T02:41:5‚Ä¶ ## $ desc \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;- Limit Objectives To a Quarter\\n- Use OKRs to‚Ä¶ ## $ descData \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,‚Ä¶ ## $ dueReminder \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, -1, -1,‚Ä¶ ## $ idBoard \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123eb\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b95‚Ä¶ ## $ idLabels \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b9501245a\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976‚Ä¶ ## $ idList \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123ec\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b95‚Ä¶ ## $ idMembersVoted \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [‚Ä¶ ## $ idShort \u0026lt;int\u0026gt; 7, 17, 18, 19, 8, 21, 22, 32, 16, 20, 25, 26, 9‚Ä¶ ## $ idAttachmentCover \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;5eb0d2742976430b950124e1\u0026quot;, NA, NA, NA, \u0026quot;5eb0d2‚Ä¶ ## $ locationName \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,‚Ä¶ ## $ manualCoverAttachment \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, ‚Ä¶ ## $ name \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;Key Objectives that the program will focus on ‚Ä¶ ## $ pos \u0026lt;dbl\u0026gt; 65535.0, 131071.0, 196607.0, 262143.0, 65535.0,‚Ä¶ ## $ shortLink \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;qvqixygv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;4rOLZNMw\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;KgVOC3qc\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;4Fly9akh\u0026quot;,‚Ä¶ ## $ isTemplate \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE‚Ä¶ ## $ badges \u0026lt;df[,14]\u0026gt; \u0026lt;data.frame[26 x 14]\u0026gt; ## $ dueComplete \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE‚Ä¶ ## $ due \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA,‚Ä¶ ## $ email \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;spcanelon+2rt0kpr4pzcxfhsnf6o+2ua72xba0q9l7pk1‚Ä¶ ## $ idChecklists \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;‚Ä¶ ## $ idMembers \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [‚Ä¶ ## $ labels \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;data.frame[0 x 0]\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;data.frame[1 x 4]\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;da‚Ä¶ ## $ limits \u0026lt;df[,3]\u0026gt; \u0026lt;data.frame[26 x 3]\u0026gt; ## $ shortUrl \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;https://trello.com/c/qvqixygv\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;https://trell‚Ä¶ ## $ subscribed \u0026lt;lgl\u0026gt; FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, FALSE‚Ä¶ ## $ url \u0026lt;chr\u0026gt; \u0026quot;https://trello.com/c/qvqixygv/7-key-objectives‚Ä¶ ## $ cover \u0026lt;df[,6]\u0026gt; \u0026lt;data.frame[26 x 6]\u0026gt; ## $ attachments \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; [\u0026lt;data.frame[1 x 11]\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;data.frame[0 x 0]\u0026gt;, \u0026lt;d‚Ä¶ ## $ pluginData \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [‚Ä¶ ## $ customFieldItems \u0026lt;list\u0026gt; [[], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [], [‚Ä¶ # selecting wanted variables cards_trim \u0026lt;- cards_flat_tbl %\u0026gt;% select(id, idShort, idList, dateLastActivity, name, desc, dueComplete, due, labels, attachments, shortUrl, closed) %\u0026gt;% arrange(desc(dateLastActivity)) 5.1.1 Labels Relevant information about the labels is selected and the unnest function is used to flatten because labels is a list of data frames. Again, I found Kan‚Äôs post helpful here! Particularly for saving the label details as a character list, which is helpful later on. Once we get to Airtable it‚Äôll be important that label information for each card be structured as a simple list of words (i.e.¬†label1, label2, label3). We get close once the labels are contained within a character list labelList, but there are still ‚Äúc‚Äùs and parentheses that need to be removed. String manipulation is something I‚Äôm still learning about so the code below is far from elegant!\n# extracting labels details labels_info \u0026lt;- cards_trim %\u0026gt;% select(id, idShort, labels) %\u0026gt;% unnest() %\u0026gt;% # no arguments because the nested items don\u0026#39;t have names rename(labelName = name) %\u0026gt;% select(id, idShort, labelName) %\u0026gt;% group_by(id, idShort) %\u0026gt;% summarize(labelList = list(labelName)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(labelList = as.character(labelList)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(labelList_tidy = str_remove_all(labelList, pattern = \u0026quot;\\\u0026quot;\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(labelList_tidy = str_remove_all(labelList_tidy, pattern =\u0026quot;c\\\\(\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% mutate(labelList_tidy = str_remove_all(labelList_tidy, pattern =\u0026quot;\\\\)\u0026quot;)) %\u0026gt;% unique() knitr::kable(labels_info %\u0026gt;% head(n = 3L))   id idShort labelList labelList_tidy    5eb0d2732976430b95012436 17 Product Product  5eb0d2732976430b95012438 18 Sales \u0026amp; Marketing Sales \u0026amp; Marketing  5eb0d2732976430b9501243a 19 Engineering Engineering    # joining back with main cards data frame ct_labels \u0026lt;- left_join(cards_trim %\u0026gt;% select(-labels), labels_info %\u0026gt;% select(-labelList))  5.1.2 Attachments The next step is to download all of the items attached to the cards onto a local folder. I found this StackOverflow post really helpful. When I tried this out on my own Trello board I also found that I couldn‚Äôt download the few attachments I had made from my local drive. This StackOverflow post helped me figure out how to flag and catch these download errors so that I could create a list of the urls with ‚Äúattachment errors‚Äù that I could follow up with manually.\n# expanding the attachment lists into separate url records att_urls \u0026lt;- ct_labels %\u0026gt;% select(idShort, attachments) %\u0026gt;% unnest() %\u0026gt;% select(idShort, url) %\u0026gt;% mutate(url = as.character(url), attachmentError = \u0026#39;FALSE\u0026#39;) knitr::kable(att_urls %\u0026gt;% head(n = 3L))     idShort url attachmentError    10 https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5eb0d2732976430b950123eb/5eb0d2732976430b95012428/x/65f56db0b02c7d71fbb20c23c6923ecf/risk.png FALSE  13 https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5eb0d2732976430b950123eb/5eb0d2732976430b9501242e/x/f400e4051bafe46d0a2918ce429c77b3/scrum.png FALSE  6 https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5eb0d2732976430b950123eb/5eb0d2732976430b95012420/x/4c5034647d03e2bfd7c8f3d95989dd84/party.png FALSE    # creating directory for attachments dirAttachments \u0026lt;- \u0026quot;attachments/\u0026quot; dir.create(dirAttachments) # downloading urls and checking for errors using try() for (i in 1:length(att_urls$url)){ locAttachments \u0026lt;- paste(dirAttachments, \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;, att_urls$idShort[i], \u0026quot;_\u0026quot;, basename(att_urls$url[i]), sep = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) step_to_try \u0026lt;- try(attachment_check \u0026lt;- download.file(att_urls$url[i], destfile = locAttachments)) if(\u0026quot;try-error\u0026quot; %in% class(step_to_try)) { cat(\u0026quot;Error row: \u0026quot;, i, \u0026quot;\\n\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;Error message: \u0026quot;, step_to_try[1], sep = \u0026quot;\u0026quot;) att_urls$attachmentError[i] = \u0026#39;TRUE\u0026#39; } } The following selects the attachment records with errors, renames somes variables, and exports the data frame as a CSV.\n# preparing data frame for export to CSV attachment_errors \u0026lt;- att_urls %\u0026gt;% filter(attachmentError == TRUE) %\u0026gt;% rename(Task_Id = idShort, Attachment_URL = url, Attachment_Error = attachmentError) # exporting to CSV write.csv(attachment_errors, file = \u0026quot;attachment_errors.csv\u0026quot;)  Aside: If you have a lot of attachments per card, you may want to create a directory folder for each card. This for loop will get you there ‚Äì use it instead of the one above:\n # creates individual directory folders for each card id for (i in 1:length(att_urls$url)){ dirAttachments \u0026lt;- paste(dirFiles, \u0026quot;attachments\u0026quot;, att_urls$idShort[i], sep = \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;) dir.create(dirAttachments) # creates directory for each unique card id locAttachments \u0026lt;- paste(dirAttachments, basename(url[i]), sep = \u0026quot;/\u0026quot;) download.file(url[i], destfile = locAttachments) } Records in the main cards data frame are labeled ‚ÄúTRUE‚Äù within the attachments column if they have attachments and ‚ÄúFALSE‚Äù if they don‚Äôt.\n# converts the attachment column to a categorical variable in the main cards+labels data frame ct_labels \u0026lt;- ct_labels %\u0026gt;% mutate(attachments = ifelse(idShort %in% att_urls$idShort, TRUE, FALSE))   5.2 Lists The lists information is extracted similarly to the cards information, but flattening is a little more straightforward because it involves only one data frame. With more data frames, the unnest function is a better choice.\n# selecting lists information lists \u0026lt;- trello$lists # list of 1 data frame glimpse(lists) ## List of 1 ## $ :\u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 11 obs. of 9 variables: ## ..$ id : chr [1:11] \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123ec\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123ed\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123ee\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123ef\u0026quot; ... ## ..$ name : chr [1:11] \u0026quot;Focus Objectives For The Quarter\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Key Performance Indicators For The Quarter\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Metrics and Reporting\u0026quot; \u0026quot;Milestones \u0026amp; Important Dates\u0026quot; ... ## ..$ closed : logi [1:11] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ... ## ..$ pos : int [1:11] 65535 131071 147455 163839 180223 188415 196607 262143 327679 393215 ... ## ..$ softLimit : logi [1:11] NA NA NA NA NA NA ... ## ..$ creationMethod: logi [1:11] NA NA NA NA NA NA ... ## ..$ idBoard : chr [1:11] \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123eb\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123eb\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123eb\u0026quot; \u0026quot;5eb0d2732976430b950123eb\u0026quot; ... ## ..$ limits :\u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 11 obs. of 1 variable: ## .. ..$ cards:\u0026#39;data.frame\u0026#39;: 11 obs. of 2 variables: ## ..$ subscribed : logi [1:11] FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE FALSE ... # flattening lists_flat \u0026lt;- lists[[1]] # 17 obs of 9 variables # selecting wanted variables lists_trim \u0026lt;- lists_flat %\u0026gt;% select(id, name, closed) %\u0026gt;% rename(idList = id, nameList = name, closedList = closed) knitr::kable(lists_trim %\u0026gt;% head(n = 3L))   idList nameList closedList    5eb0d2732976430b950123ec Focus Objectives For The Quarter FALSE  5eb0d2732976430b950123ed Key Performance Indicators For The Quarter FALSE  5eb0d2732976430b950123ee Metrics and Reporting FALSE    # joining back with main cards+labels data frame ct_labels_list \u0026lt;- left_join(ct_labels, lists_trim) %\u0026gt;% select(id:shortUrl, labelList_tidy:nameList, closed, closedList)   6 Exporting to CSV 6.1 Data prepping Columns in the new ct_labels_list data frame are given new names, and the lubridate package is used next to convert the date fields.

Add a base \u0026gt; Import a spreadsheet \u0026gt; CSV file. Upload the cards_tidy.csv file. Pick a name, icon, and color for your brand new base! More detailed instructions can be found in this Airtable article.\n7.1 Task Because we know each observation in our table is unique, we can copy and paste Task into the first column and hide/delete the original column. Task is now the primary field.   7.2 Task_ID Convert Task_ID field type to ‚Äúnumber‚Äù.   7.3 Notes Convert Notes field type to ‚Äúlong text‚Äù and enable rich text formatting. This gives us the option of using Markdown in the future, but sadly doesn‚Äôt automatically recognize fully formatted Markdown in the imported text.   7.4 Labels Change Labels field type to ‚Äúmultiple select‚Äù so that it turns each item in each list into a label. Optional: Create a new Projects column next to Labels and use the labels to guide you in creating Project labels/categories: Group the records by Labels field and add to Projects field as appropriate.   I recommend creating an NA project from the NA labels so that these tasks aren‚Äôt marked as ‚Äúuncategorized‚Äù in the Projects column. Having records with an ‚Äúempty‚Äù assignment gets in the way whenever you want to group by that category. To that end, it‚Äôs helpful to group by Project and make sure any ‚Äúempty‚Äù records get assigned to the ‚ÄúNA‚Äù Project.   Delete from Labels any labels that were converted to Projects and ungroup the records.   7.5 Trello_Lists Convert Trello_Lists column field type into ‚Äúsingle select‚Äù. This gives us the option of using the Kanban style we were used to in Trello.   Every record should already be associated with a Trello_List.   If you want to replicate the Trello kanban layout, change the order of the single select options in Trello_Lists to match the order from left-to-right of your Trello board   7.6 Trello_URL Convert the Trello_URL field type to ‚ÄúURL‚Äù and then hide it if you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll reference it often.   7.7 Trello_Attachments Convert Trello_Attachments field type to ‚Äúsingle select‚Äù Create a new Attachments column with field type ‚Äúattachment‚Äù. This is where you‚Äôll upload your downloaded attachments. Filter your records by Trello_Attachments so only show ‚ÄúTRUE‚Äù results Sort records by Task_ID and simplify your view by temporarily hiding all columns except for Task_Name (primary field), Task_ID, Trello_Attachments, and the new Attachments column. Open your local attachments folder and drag and drop the files to their corresponding Attachments field according to their Task_ID in the filename.   Increase the height of the records for this step. It‚Äôll make it easier to make sure you‚Äôre dragging and dropping to the correct record   If you encountered errors downloading some of your attachment URLs, now is the time to check your local attachment_errors.csv file for the URLs with errors during the download process. These are attachments you‚Äôll have to find elsewhere and upload to the Attachments field as needed. Remove the filter to your view and unhide any columns you wish to remain visible.   7.8 Done \u0026amp; Archived Convert the Done and Archived field types to ‚ÄúCheckbox‚Äù and it will automatically assign a ‚Äúcheck‚Äù to all records marked ‚ÄúTRUE‚Äù and leave the ones marked ‚ÄúFALSE‚Äù or ‚ÄúNA‚Äù unchecked. So easy! There is no direct option to ‚Äúarchive‚Äù tasks that have been completed like you can do in Trello, but you can apply a filter to your table view to hide the tasks that are complete. To do this, set the filter so that the Done and Archived fields are unchecked.   This must be repeated for each saved View of your records.     8 Moving forward 8.1 Dates Modify Date_Due and Trello_Last_Modified field types to ‚ÄúDate‚Äù with time. You can sort the records by Trello_Last_Modified if that‚Äôs helpful, but otherwise you can hide the column and keep it for historical reference. Create a new column Last_Modified with field type ‚ÄúLast modified time‚Äù and select all columns you want to track changes to on a date/time basis moving forward.   8.2 Record Views Select Kanban from the Views options and group by Trello_List to see your tasks similar to how you saw them in Trello, complete with attachment covers! A bonus is that if you have multiple images attached to a card, you can view them without expanding the card by just hovering over the attachment cover! Move, collapse, and delete stacks as you see fit. Customize cards with as little or as much information as you want.   8.3 Tasks vs Subtasks There are probably many ways to parallel the checklist option Trello gives you within a card.\n The most straightforward is to use the basic checklist formatting within the Description field to create lists Another is to think of your primary field Tasks instead as ‚Äòsubtasks‚Äô and create a new column to serve as the umbrella ‚Äòtask‚Äô. This new ‚Äòtask‚Äô column would be field type ‚Äúsingle selection‚Äù, then you could group your records by ‚Äòtask‚Äô.

It didn‚Äôt take long to realize the kind of information needed to understand what it‚Äôs like to engage in recovery didn‚Äôt live in quantitative datasets. So we endeavored to collect our own qualitative data instead! We conducted interviews with our partner organizations and other major players in Philly as part of this storytelling project.\nOur team‚Äôs final report, presentation, and ‚Äúscrollytelling‚Äù mock-up are linked above. A slide deck created for a lab meeting presentation is also linked, and summarizes the content.\nBe sure to check out these Freakonomics Radio podcast episodes to learn more about the opioid crisis in Philly:\n Part 1: ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve Addicted an Entire Generation‚Äù Part 2: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Not a Death Sentence‚Äù  Data Hack hosts  Code for Philly DataPhilly R-Ladies Philly Philly Data Jawn City of Philadelphia   Partner organizations/interviewees  Prevention Point Prevention: drop-in, medical, mobile clinic, and re-entry case managers. Health Federation of Philadelphia: Opioid Response Program Coordinator and intern. Penn Medicine Center for Opioid Recovery and Engagement: Certified recovery specialists, emergency medicine physician, and individual in recovery.    Overview Recovery from opioid dependency often is a long and difficult journey, and it will look different for different people. For some, recovery can mean reducing dependency to a minimal level that allows them to successfully maintain their emotional, social, and economic daily life. While many programs are in place to help, recovery is a voluntary commitment from a person who might need continual encouragement and understanding, as well as assistance navigating hurdles they might not be able to overcome on their own, especially if they are going through the agony of withdrawal. Managing withdrawal symptoms is a first step toward long-term treatment, and not recognizing this need and responding to it with compassion and respect can waste an opportunity that might not come around again. Likewise, a failure to provide understanding or timely referrals at any critical point along the recovery process can lead to relapses, creating a vicious cycle of continuous addiction. Understanding what people are going through and what they need are the keys to helping people on their journey toward sustained recovery.\n Recurring Themes in Recovery We observed a number of recurring themes in the qualitative data collected.\n Every recovery path is unique. Often, a person‚Äôs recovery is non-linear, includes setbacks and does not have a clear end point. This can make visualizing a journey difficult, because there is no ‚Äútypical‚Äù recovery. The perfect recovery process is the one perfect for that person. The best recovery process is one that meets an individual exactly where they are, free of external barriers and judgment, and full of respect and compassion. Relapse can happen during recovery. An individual can relapse but this does not mean that their recovery is over. Mindset for recovery. Recovery can only begin when a person is ready. Until that point, their access to harm reduction education and harm reduction services is extremely important. Role of long-term relationships between individuals with OUD and agencies that provide recovery services. Thanks to these long term relationships, a person knows where to turn when they are ready for help. Stigma and recovery. If an individual was treated poorly in the past by an emergency response person or at a healthy clinic, they may refuse treatment in the future. Some abstinence-based treatment programs do not condone substance use of any kind, including MAT. Stigma exists within advocacy in the form of promoting Vivitrol, which has disadvantages when compared to buprenorphine, but cannot be diverted. Benefit of ‚ÄúLived Experience‚Äù. When case managers can share that they have ‚Äúlived experience‚Äù and are in recovery themselves, it often makes individuals more comfortable. These case managers are able to offer compassion because they have been through withdrawal and some of the same challenges themselves. Vulnerable Populations. While there may not be a typical recovery story, it is certain that there are populations for whom there exist even more obstacles to recovery. These vulnerable populations include: homeless, uninsured, mothers, formerly incarcerated, and people with a dual diagnosis of OUD and mental illness.
