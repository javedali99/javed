  Hello!

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
Thanks for stopping by!

I’m currently pursuing a PhD in Civil Engineering (Major: Water Resources Engineering) in the **Coastal Risks and Engineering Lab** at the [University of Central Florida (UCF)](https://www.ucf.edu/). I’ve been working on a **National Academy of Sciences (NAS)** funded project “The New First Line of Defense: Building Community Resilience through Residential Risk Disclosure” for studying the multi-hazards risk including their possible spatial and temporal interactions and dynamic vulnerability and exposure. Before joining the UCF, I was working at the [Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique (CNRS)](http://www.cnrs.fr/) in France as a MOPGA Researcher. My work at CNRS focused on coupled modelling of flash floods and population exposure and vulnerability dynamics for forecasting the potential socio-economic impacts of flash floods in South France.
